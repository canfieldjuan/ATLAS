# extracted_llm_infrastructure — STATUS

## Phase 1 — Scaffold creation ✅

| Step | Status |
|---|---|
| Manifest of source → scaffold mappings | ✅ done |
| Verbatim byte-snapshot of 14 Python files | ✅ done |
| Verbatim byte-snapshot of 6 migration SQL files | ✅ done |
| Package `__init__.py` files at every level | ✅ done |
| Sync + validate scripts | ✅ done |
| ASCII / smoke-import / import-debt checks | ✅ done |
| Driver script `run_extracted_llm_infrastructure_checks.sh` | ✅ done |
| GitHub Actions workflow | ✅ done |
| README + this STATUS file | ✅ done |
| `import_debt_allowlist.txt` documenting atlas_brain dependencies | ✅ done |

## Phase 2 — Standalone substrate ✅ (landed)

Goal: the package's substrate (settings, base class, protocols, registry, db pool) loads its own implementation instead of delegating to atlas_brain when `EXTRACTED_LLM_INFRA_STANDALONE=1` is set.

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| Carve `LLMInfraSettings` (LLMSubConfig + B2BChurnSubConfig + ReasoningSubConfig + FTLTracingSubConfig + ModelPricingConfig) | ✅ `_standalone/config.py` |
| Standalone Message / ModelInfo / InferenceMetrics / LLMService Protocol | ✅ `_standalone/protocols.py` |
| Torch-free `BaseModelService` ABC | ✅ `_standalone/base.py` |
| `ServiceRegistry` + `llm_registry` singleton + `@register_llm` | ✅ `_standalone/registry.py` |
| Slim `DatabasePool` wrapper around asyncpg | ✅ `_standalone/database.py` |
| Bridge stubs gate on `EXTRACTED_LLM_INFRA_STANDALONE=1` | ✅ five bridges updated |
| Standalone smoke script + CI integration | ✅ `scripts/smoke_extracted_llm_infrastructure_standalone.py` |
| README documents the toggle and env-var layout | ✅ |

**Empirical result**: the standalone substrate landed in this PR turns out to be sufficient to unblock the import contract for all 14 provider modules. They consume the substrate transitively through the bridge stubs, so when `EXTRACTED_LLM_INFRA_STANDALONE=1` is set, every provider sees the local `_standalone/*` copies of `BaseModelService`, `LLMService` Protocol, `Message`, `ModelInfo`, `ServiceRegistry`, `llm_registry`, `settings`, and `DatabasePool`.

The standalone smoke (`scripts/smoke_extracted_llm_infrastructure_standalone.py`) verifies this end-to-end: it sets the env var, imports every provider, and asserts (via `__module__` walk on `AnthropicLLM.__mro__`) that providers transitively consume the standalone substrate rather than silently falling back to atlas_brain.

## Phase 3 — Runtime decoupling 🔲 (later PRs)

Import contract is closed; the remaining work is **runtime** behavior when functions execute, not when modules load:

| Task | Source file referenced |
|---|---|
| `Protocol`-based DI for LLM instances; replace `isinstance(AnthropicLLM)` checks | `services/b2b/anthropic_batch.py:550, 740, 1034, 1144` and `services/llm_router.py:205-247` |
| Extract `_convert_messages` from `AnthropicLLM` so batch code does not call a private method | `services/llm/anthropic.py:103+`, called from `services/b2b/anthropic_batch.py:409` |
| Decouple `SemanticCache` from Postgres (asyncpg.Record assumptions) | `reasoning/semantic_cache.py:70-339` |
| Move `evidence_hash` computation to a single owner | currently split between `reasoning/semantic_cache.py:47` and B2B callers |
| Open-source-grade README + LICENSE + pyproject.toml | scaffold root |
| Publishable PyPI package | scaffold root |
