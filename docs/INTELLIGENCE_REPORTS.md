# Intelligence Reports Strategy

## Relationship + Connection Lifecycle

Atlas already captures relationships as graph episodes (entities + edges) via Graphiti. Each relationship is stored with:
- **Source evidence** (email, call transcript, document, CRM interaction)
- **Timestamps + confidence** (Graphiti metadata)
- **Revision history** (new episodes add context, they do not overwrite past facts)

This means every connection we discover becomes an auditable data point that can be reused later for reporting and monetization.

## Aggregation → Report Dataset

When enough data is collected, reports are generated by assembling a **report dataset**:
1. **Select a subject** (person, company, market, or operation).
2. **Traverse relationships** (multi-hop graph traversal for key connections).
3. **Enrich with CRM** (interactions, appointments, revenue, sentiment).
4. **Score signals** by recency, frequency, business impact, and confidence.
5. **Cluster insights** into themes (risk, opportunity, influence, growth).

The output is a structured bundle of facts + relationships + evidence, ready for synthesis.

## Generating Sellable Intelligence Reports

Use the `intelligence/report` skill prompt to generate a customer-ready report with:
- **Executive summary** (why it matters + business impact)
- **Relationship map** (who/what is connected and why)
- **Key insights** (patterns, changes, anomalies)
- **Evidence** (citations back to the graph + source text)
- **Risks & opportunities** (actionable implications)
- **Recommended actions** (next steps for the client)
- **Confidence & coverage** (what is strong vs. what needs more data)

The report should read like a premium analyst brief: concise, defensible, and decision-oriented.

## Prompt-to-Report Executive Summary

Use the `intelligence/prompt_to_report` agent when you only have raw behavioral triggers and need a clinical, predictive executive summary in a high-authority tone. It outputs a single EXECUTIVE SUMMARY section with evidence citations.

---

## Adaptive Intervention Agent

Use the `intelligence/adaptive_intervention` agent after the report is produced to generate a F.A.T.E. (Focus, Authority, Tribe, Emotion)-based tactical playbook. It outputs Authority Pivot, Narrative Re-Framing Script, Tribe Re-Integration Plan, and counter-pressure actions tied to the identified pressure points.

---

## Simulated Evolution & Predictive Forensics Agent

Use the `intelligence/simulated_evolution` agent after the intervention playbook to run what-if simulations, pre-mortems, and reverse-engineer the optimal outcome. It produces a digital-twin simulation brief with scenario matrices, ghost-signal forensics (hidden early-warning indicators surfaced by pre-mortems), and T-minus 48 linguistic calibrations.

---

## Autonomous Narrative Architect Agent

Use the `intelligence/autonomous_narrative_architect` agent after the simulator to design narrative micro-interventions that stabilize the environment. It outputs parallel narrative design, micro-intervention plans, and a first intervention definition scoped to the hours-before-event window.

Safeguards for this agent:
- Explicit human oversight and approval workflows
- Consented channels with access restrictions
- Audit logging and ethical boundary checks in the orchestration layer

## Report Structure, Visuals, and Writing Models

**Structure** (recommended ordering for premium clients):
1. Executive summary (decision impact + next steps)
2. Relationship map (key entities, influence, and scoring)
3. Evidence highlights (top sources + confidence)
4. Risks & opportunities (ranked)
5. Recommended actions (owner + timing)
6. Confidence & coverage (data gaps)

**Visuals vs. plain text**:
- **4-figure** reports ($1,000–$9,999) can be plain text with 1–2 visuals (relationship map + evidence table).
- **5-figure** reports ($10,000+) should be visual-heavy (deck or dashboard) with charts that reinforce scoring and evidence.

**Suggested charts/graphs**:
- Relationship network graph (entities + edges sized by confidence)
- Signal scorecard (recency, frequency, impact, confidence)
- Timeline of key events (evidence anchored by date)
- Risk/opportunity matrix (impact vs. likelihood)
- CRM revenue/interaction summary (pipeline or touchpoint volume)

**Writing models**:
- **Drafting**: local `qwen3:14b` for fast synthesis and internal reviews.
- **Polish**: cloud `minimax-m2:cloud` for executive-ready narrative and tone.

---

## Selling the Reports

Package reports into tiers that clients can buy:
- **Snapshot Report** (one-time dossier, PDF/HTML export)
- **Monitoring Report** (weekly/monthly updates + deltas)
- **Strategic Intelligence** (ongoing briefings + custom alerts)

Selling points:
- **Evidence-backed insights** (not opinions)
- **Relationship-driven discoveries** (non-obvious connections)
- **Actionable recommendations** (clear next steps)

---

## High-Ticket Report Builder (4–5 Figures)

Use the `intelligence/report_builder` skill to scope premium report packages for high-ticket clients.

- **4-figure package**: rapid intelligence snapshot, relationship map, and action brief.
- **5-figure package**: deep-dive analysis, multi-source enrichment, and executive briefing cadence.

Each package should justify pricing based on evidence density, relationship scoring, and decision impact.

## Next Implementation Hooks

- GraphRAG relationship traversal (`lib/graphrag/graphiti/traversal-service.ts`)
- CRM context enrichment (`atlas_brain/services/customer_context.py`)
- LLM synthesis via skill prompts (`atlas_brain/skills/intelligence/report.md`)

These hooks let us ship intelligence reports without new infrastructure—just orchestration and packaging.
