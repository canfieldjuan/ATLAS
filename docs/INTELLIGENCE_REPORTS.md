# Intelligence Reports Strategy

## Relationship + Connection Lifecycle

Atlas already captures relationships as graph episodes (entities + edges) via Graphiti. Each relationship is stored with:
- **Source evidence** (email, call transcript, document, CRM interaction)
- **Timestamps + confidence** (Graphiti metadata)
- **Revision history** (new episodes add context, they do not overwrite past facts)

This means every connection we discover becomes an auditable data point that can be reused later for reporting and monetization.

## Aggregation → Report Dataset

When enough data is collected, reports are generated by assembling a **report dataset**:
1. **Select a subject** (person, company, market, or operation).
2. **Traverse relationships** (multi-hop graph traversal for key connections).
3. **Enrich with CRM** (interactions, appointments, revenue, sentiment).
4. **Score signals** by recency, frequency, business impact, and confidence.
5. **Cluster insights** into themes (risk, opportunity, influence, growth).

The output is a structured bundle of facts + relationships + evidence, ready for synthesis.

## Generating Sellable Intelligence Reports

Use the `intelligence/report` skill prompt to generate a customer-ready report with:
- **Executive summary** (why it matters + business impact)
- **Relationship map** (who/what is connected and why)
- **Key insights** (patterns, changes, anomalies)
- **Evidence** (citations back to the graph + source text)
- **Risks & opportunities** (actionable implications)
- **Recommended actions** (next steps for the client)
- **Confidence & coverage** (what is strong vs. what needs more data)

The report should read like a premium analyst brief: concise, defensible, and decision-oriented.

## Selling the Reports

Package reports into tiers that clients can buy:
- **Snapshot Report** (one-time dossier, PDF/HTML export)
- **Monitoring Report** (weekly/monthly updates + deltas)
- **Strategic Intelligence** (ongoing briefings + custom alerts)

Selling points:
- **Evidence-backed insights** (not opinions)
- **Relationship-driven discoveries** (non-obvious connections)
- **Actionable recommendations** (clear next steps)

## Next Implementation Hooks

- GraphRAG relationship traversal (`lib/graphrag/graphiti/traversal-service.ts`)
- CRM context enrichment (`atlas_brain/services/customer_context.py`)
- LLM synthesis via skill prompts (`atlas_brain/skills/intelligence/report.md`)

These hooks let us ship intelligence reports without new infrastructure—just orchestration and packaging.
