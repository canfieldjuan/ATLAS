"""
Omni (speech-to-speech) service implementations.

This module contains implementations of the OmniService protocol
for unified speech-in, speech-out models.
"""

# Implementations are imported here to trigger registration
# Currently no implementations - PersonaPlex is used directly
# via the comms module rather than through the omni registry.
