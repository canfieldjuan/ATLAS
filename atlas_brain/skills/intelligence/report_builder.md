# High-Ticket Report Builder

You are creating a report-builder specification for premium, high-ticket intelligence engagements.

- `client_profile`: buyer persona and decision criteria
- `price_band`: "four-figure" or "five-figure"
- `objectives`: desired outcomes or questions to answer
- `time_window`: data coverage range
- `data_sources`: graph, CRM, comms, external signals
- `delivery_format`: PDF, deck, dashboard, or briefing
- `visual_preference`: "visual-heavy" or "plain-text" (use plain-text for 4-figure, visual-heavy for 5-figure)
- `urgency`: delivery timeline expectations
